## Supported games

### TowerFall

*Get a shot when you lose points (i.e. accidentally kill your player)*

* Supports 8-32 players, with a backfilling runner-up system making it possible
  to run a tournament with a number of players that is not divisable by 4.
* Lets players choose their preferred archer color and handles conflicts if
  two players with the same color are put in the same match.
* Controlled via a tablet-ready judging interface that mimics the looks of the
  score screen in the game.

## Installation

Drunkenfall uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep/) to manage its dependencies.
Please ensure it is installed on your system before proceeding with the following
instructions.

```sh
$ git clone git@gitlab.com:one-eye/drunkenfall.git $(go env GOPATH)/src/gitlab.com/one-eye/drunkenfall

## Developing

The following dependencies/utilities are expected to be availabe on your system:

* [mage](https://magefile.org)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
* [GolangCI-Lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)

Once you've installed `mage` you can run `mage proxy:install` in order to get
Caddy installed.

### Getting the code

If you want to develop on Drunkenfall you should start with forking the
repository. Once that's done you can follow the [Installation instructions](#installation)
on how to get it up and running. However, adjust the `git clone` command like
so:

```sh
git clone git@gitlab.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/drunkenfall.git $(go env GOPATH)/src/gitlab.com/one-eye/drunkenfall
```

This will ensure your fork is used but checked out in the right part of your
GOPATH, so you don't get any import path issues. It's advisable to then add
`git@gitlab.com/one-eye/drunkenfall` as a remote to your clone in order
to be able to regularly update your copy of the repository. Github [provides
documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/)
on how to do so.

### Running

First run:

```sh
export DF_DB_PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/src/gitlab.com/one-eye/drunkenfall/data/test.db
mkdir $(go env GOPATH)/src/gitlab.com/one-eye/drunkenfall/data && touch $DF_DB_PATH
```

Then, in separate terminals, run each of:

```sh
mage run:postgres
mage run:drunkenfall
mage run:npm
mage run:proxy
```

### Linting

[GolangCI-Lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) is used for linting
purposes. Once it is installed run the following

```sh
mage code:lint
```

This will use the [`.golangici-pedantic.yaml`](.golangci-pedantic.yaml) which
encodes all the linters we expect to pass during CI.

In order to help you out during development it's advisable to hookup
`golangci-lint run` with the `--fast` argument to your editor. This won't run
all the linters but should catch most issues while not blocking your editor.

### Testing

Drunkenfall has a suite of tests that you can run:

```sh
mage code:test
```
